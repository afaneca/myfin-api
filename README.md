# ⚡ About MyFin

MyFin originated as my own passion project in 2020. At that point, I'd already tried a bunch of other FPM's, but all of
them lacked in at least one of the following points:

- They were not user-friendly
- Their features lacked a full-fledged budgeting tool
- I was never in control of my own data

MyFin is my <u>attempt</u> to solve all of these issues. It has helped me manage my finances for a while now and I hope
it can be useful for you as well.

# 🔰 Getting Started

This project relies on NodeJS's Express framework for its backend and there's where most of the initial setup will take place
if you want to deploy this solution to your own server.

[Here](https://github.com/afaneca/myfin-api/wiki/Getting-started) you can find the full documentation on the
first steps to get started.

# 🙋‍♂️ Contributing

This was never meant to be anything other than a little passion project of mine. However, if you're interested in taking
this project and make it your own or add something to it, you're more than welcome to do so. Just get in touch :)
