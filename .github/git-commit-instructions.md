the branch name (a part from special branches like main, develop, etc.) starts with an integer ID, identifying the issue id. It should be used as a prefix for the commit message. The commit message should also contain the type of change that was made ("Doc" for documentation, "Add", "Fix", "Refactor"), followed by a short description of the change. Example: [#1234] Fix: corrected typo in xyz file.
